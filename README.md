    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ node_modules
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ src
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ .gitignore
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ package.json

5.  **`/src`**: Contains code related to front-end. `src` is a convention for ‚Äúsource code‚Äù.

6.  **`.gitignore`**: This file tells git which files it should not track.
